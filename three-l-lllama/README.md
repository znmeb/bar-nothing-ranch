# three-l-lllama

 The one-l lama,<br>
 He's a priest.<br>
 The two-l llama,<br>
 He's a beast.<br>
 And I will bet<br>
 A silk pajama<br>
 There isn't any<br>
 Three-l lllama.*<br>

Well, sir, there is a three-l lllama now! _Lua, LLVM and LLMs!_

## Introduction

`three-l-llama` is a pet [`Distrobox`](https://distrobox.it/) container
designed for developers exploring large language models (LLMs) and the
[`LLVM`](https://llvm.org/) compiler infrastructure. The first release
features [Unsloth Studio](https://unsloth.ai/docs/new/studio), the
[Claude](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference),
[Codex](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli),
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/cli/) and
[Pi](https://pi.dev/) command line coding agents, and
[`Terra`](https://terralang.org).

Unsloth Studio and the coding agents provide the infrastructure for
running LLMs locally and using them for coding assistance. `three-l-llama`
uses Unsloth Studio because it provides model tuning tools in addition to
simply downloading and running models.

`LLVM` is installed as `apt` packages from <https://apt.llvm.org/>;
the current stable version is 22. `Terra`, compiled from source, provides
Lua-based tools for exploring and using `LLVM`.

`Terra` is a low-level language tightly integrated with Lua. `Terra` is
designed for creating domain-specific languages using `LLVM`, including
languages using `CUDA` GPUs. Lua 5.5, the
[Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) Lisp-like Lua front end, and the
[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) package manager are also included.

Finally, `three-l-lllama` provides a command line based on
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), including the [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
shell prompt generator, two ["nerd fonts"](https://www.nerdfonts.com/),
and the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) editor.

## Getting started on a Linux host

You will need Distrobox and Podman installed. Recent version of Fedora,
Ubuntu, Debian, Arch and their derivatives all have usable versions, so it's
just a matter of installing them in the package manager.

I don't have any AMD CPUs or GPUs so I can't help you with specific tuning issues.
For NVIDIA, you should have a GTX 1600 / RTX 2000 series card or newer. You need
the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host but you do not need `CUDA` - that runs in
the container!

```
git clone https://github.com/AlgoCompSynth/three-l-lllama.git
cd three-l-lllama
./1-create-distrobox.sh
```
This will create the container and its home directory. If the script detects an
existing container, it will exit without doing anything! Otherwise, it will create a
base image and a container.

If the script detects an NVIDIA GPU, the container will be called `three-l-lllama-CUDA`
and its home directory will be `~/three-l-lllama-CUDA-Home`. If it does not find a GPU
these will be `three-l-lllama-CPU` and `~/three-l-lllama-CPU-Home`. The home directory
will be created if it does not exist.

This is what a typical run looks like:

```
❯ ./1-create-distrobox.sh
* Create Distrobox *
